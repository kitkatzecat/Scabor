# Scabor
A story-driven investigation/mystery game written in web languages (cause that's what I know)

I had originally started making this game earlier this year but the code was bad so I'm re-writing it from the ground up.

It's all just JavaScript/HTML/CSS/etc. so it should be able to be run right after being downloaded. Tested to work in Edge (both the classic Edge engine and the Chromium-based one) cause that's the browser I use.
